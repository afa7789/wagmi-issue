Issue related to type error on more up to date ( after 0.9 wagmi ) 

I can't define my chain providers ( I would rollback but need to use moonbeam )

# How to run stuff:
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) + [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) project bootstrapped with [`create-wagmi`](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/wagmi/tree/main/packages/create-wagmi)

# Getting Started

Run `npm run dev` in your terminal, and then open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Once the webpage has loaded, changes made to files inside the `src/` directory (e.g. `src/pages/index.tsx`) will automatically update the webpage.
